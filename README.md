This algorithm implements the merge sort algorithm, which is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array of integers. 
It splits the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts those sub-arrays, and then merges them back together. 
The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it very efficient for large arrays.
